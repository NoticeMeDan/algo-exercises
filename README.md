# algo-exercises
A collection of (WIP) answers to the exercises given in the Algorithms and Data structures at ITU.

## Conventions for this repo
Create a new folder in the root directory, with the name of the exercise.

If you're setting up DrJava, set the projects compile directory to `dist`, as this will be ignored by git.  

If you're not using DrJava, and don't compile to a `dist` directory, then please don't add your compiled junk to git. It sucks.
