2.1.19 - Shellsort worst case

Just like insertion sort, shellsort's worst case occurs when the array is in reverse sorted order.
This causes every element to be compared with all previous elements in the increment sequence.
The array would then have the values: 100, 99, 98, ..., 3, 2, 1
In this case the time complexity is O(N^3/2)
