2.1.13 - Deck sort
I would use shellsort twice.
For each shellsort I  would use an increment sequence starting at the closest multiple of N/3 + 1 to the deck size.
The increment would be divided by 3 at the end of every iteration.

The first shellsort would sort the deck by suit.
The second shellsort would sort the deck by rank within each suit.

Alternatively, quick sort or merge sort could be used, sorting by suit and rank.
