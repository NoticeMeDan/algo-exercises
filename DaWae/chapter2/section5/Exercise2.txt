2.5.2

The compareTo() is a flawed implementation of the Comparable interface because it violates the Comparable contract.
It is possible that a.compareTo(b) and b.compareTo(c) are both 0, but a.compareTo(c) is positive (or negative).
To fix this problem both "amount" variables should be compared directly:

if(this.amount < that.amount) return -1;
if(this.amount > that.amount) return +1;
return 0;
