When Quick.sort() is run on an array having items with just two distinct keys it only calls the partition subroutine once.
When Quick.sort() is run on an array having items with just three distinct keys it only calls the partition subroutine twice.
In the case of just three distinct keys, using quicksort with 3-way partitioning, only one call to the partition subroutine is needed.
