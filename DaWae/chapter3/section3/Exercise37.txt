3.3.37 - Memoryless

Red-black BSTs are not memoryless because the rebalance (rotations and colorings) made when inserting a new minimum value and when deleting the immediately-inserted minimum value occur in opposite directions and lead to the same balanced tree. 
This can be seen is this example:

  (B)3
(R)2

Insert a key smaller than all keys
    (B)3
  (R)2
(R)1

     (B)2          (Rotate right)
  (R)1  (R)3

     (R)2          (Flip colors)
  (B)1  (B)3

     (B)2          (Flip color of root)
  (B)1  (B)3

Delete the minimum
     (R)2          (Flip color of root)
  (B)1  (B)3

     (B)2          (Flip colors)
  (R)1  (R)3

     (B)2          (Delete min)
        (R)3

     (B)3          (Rotate left)
   (R)2
