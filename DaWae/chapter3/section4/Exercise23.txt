Since R is a power of 2, only the first lg(R) bits are used to compute the hashcode.
This can be seen with the strings "rene" and "ener".

"rene" has hashcode 43
hash = 0
hash = (256 * 0 + 82) % 255 = 82
hash = (256 * 82 + 69) % 255 = 151
hash = (256 * 151 + 78) % 255 = 229
hash = (256 * 229 + 69) % 255 = 43

"ener" also has hashcode 43
hash = 0
hash = (256 * 0 + 69) % 255 = 69
hash = (256 * 69 + 78) % 255 = 147
hash = (256 * 147 + 69) % 255 = 216
hash = (256 * 216 + 82) % 255 = 43
