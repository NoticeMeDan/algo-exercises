10^9 sites
10^6 input pairs
Computer can execute 10^9 instructions per second

The object initialization makes ~10^9 instructions (1 for initializing the count variable, 1 for creating the parents array
and 10^9 for initializing each parent)
Each find operation makes 1 instruction
Each union operation makes ~10^9 instructions (1 for each find(), 1 for comparing parents of the components being united, 
10^9 for comparing parents, 1 to 10^9 for updating parents and 1 for reducing the count of components)

For 10^6 input pairs, the total number of instructions required (I) is:
I = M x IU x MI

Where M is the number of input pairs, IU is the number of instructions in the union operation and MI is the number of machine instructions per iteration of the inner for loop.

I = 10^6 x 10^9 x 10
I = 10^16

Seconds needed = 10^16 / 10^9
Seconds needed = 10^7

10^7 seconds = 166 minutes = 2,777 hours = ~115 days

Thanks for kaustubhb (https://github.com/kaustubhb) for noting that the MI parameter was missing in the formula.
