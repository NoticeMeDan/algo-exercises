1.5.15 - Binomial trees

In the worst-case tree in weighted quick-union, a union between two trees of the same size always occurs.

Example of the result of a union between two trees of size 4:

       X
    X  X X
   X X X
   X

The number of nodes at each level will always be a binomial coefficient because the tree includes the trees resulted from
a union between two other trees of size N/2.
Therefore the number of nodes will be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and so on, as the level increases.

Average depth of a node in a worst-case tree with N = 2^n nodes:

There are exactly (k) nodes at depth i for i = 0, 1, ..., k
                  (i)

O(lg N) comparisons are made to reach each node (starting at the root), which gives a total of O(N lg N) for the tree.
The average depth of a node is 1/N * O(N lg N) = O(lg N)
