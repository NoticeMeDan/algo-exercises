4.1.14

If we use a stack instead of a queue when running breadth-first search, it does not compute shortest paths.
This can be seen in the following graph:

  0 (source)
 / \
1 - 2

Using a stack the distance from 0 to 1 will be 1 and from 0 to 2 will be 2.
Using a queue, the distance from 0 to both 1 and 2 will be 1.
